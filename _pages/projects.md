<p><strong>Speech Emotion Recognition</strong><br>
W April’23- May’23<br>
Course Project | Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition | Guide: Prof. Richa Singh</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed an emotion detection model for classifying eight distinct human emotions within input audio signals.</li>
  <li>Implemented and trained ANNs with sigmoid activation functions to achieve 97% accuracy.</li>
  <li>Trained SVM models on Mel Spectrogram and Fourier Transform Dataset, achieving a precision of 0.972 and 0.954.</li>

<p><strong>Youtube Comment Classification</strong><br>
W March’23-April’23<br>
Course Project | Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition | Guide: Prof. Richa Singh</p>
<ul>
  <li>Built a machine-learning model to cluster comments from diverse Youtube content creators to identify spam comments.</li>
  <li>Applied agglomerative, k-means, and spectral clustering to distinguishing between spam and genuine content.</li>
  <li>Achieved a Calinski-Harabasz score of 190 and a silhouette score of 0.7 with the spectral clustering using RBF kernel.</li>
</ul>
