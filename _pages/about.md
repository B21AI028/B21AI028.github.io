Hello! ðŸ˜Š I recently completed my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur. Over the past four years, I've developed a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, software development and natural language processing â€” and Iâ€™ve particularly enjoyed working on problems at the intersection of large language models and biometrics.

Currently, I'm looking for exciting opportunities as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) or Machine Learning Engineer, where I can apply my skills, grow with a team, and make an impact.

Feel free to drop me an [e-mail](mailto:sankhla.2@iitj.ac.in) if you want to chat with me!
